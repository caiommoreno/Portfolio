# Data Scientist specialized on marketing

Formed in Electrical Engineer, I found myself on data analysis and artificial intelligence world.

Passionate in solving problems, always trying to improve myself in new challenges. Working as a freelancer giving orientation for small and medium business, helping them to have a data-driven methodology.

I trust that the entirety of sentient life on this planet used only one tool to evolve: the mistake — and recognizing my weakness, mistakes and limitations will absolutely upgrade my skills as a professional, finding new obstacles and learning all the time.


**Experienced in**: Python, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
